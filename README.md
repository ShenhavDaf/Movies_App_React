#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Dependencies:

To install all development dependencies from package.json run:

#### `npm install`

## OMDb API:

IMDb is the authoritative source of all movie information, but they donâ€™t have a public API. So to retrieve movie information we can use at OMDb (Open Movie Database) API - a free web service to obtain movie information.
